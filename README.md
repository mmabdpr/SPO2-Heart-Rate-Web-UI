# Overview

This is the front-end of the Embedded Systems final course project.

## What I've done

- Built a heart rate and SPO2 measurement toolkit using Arduino along with a Web-based real-time graph and alarm system.
- Leveraged UDP protocol over Wi-FI to transfer the real-time data from ESP32 sensors to a Web client.
- Implemented an ASP.NET Blazor solution to show real-time graphs which has a searching functionality for the logs.
- Used SQLite for data persistence.

## Notes and Acknowledgements

- This project is done in collaboration with [Amir Ehsandar](https://github.com/ehsundar) as part of our Embedded Systems course.
